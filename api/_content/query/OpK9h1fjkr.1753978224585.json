My contributions included implementing RMSD-based stability metrics, computing binding energy estimates, and building interactive Python modules for 3D visualization of receptor-binding domains. This work supported high-throughput screening of nanobodyâ€“antigen interactions for pandemic response and therapeutic design."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:adaptyv-sybodies.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/adaptyv-sybodies.md","_stem":"projects/adaptyv-sybodies","_extension":"md"}
