I built the platform to support biological protocols, metadata tracking, and result annotation with seamless integration of visualization tools. Goalgi was incubated through the iGEM EPIC (Entrepreneurship Program & Innovation Community) initiative, where it was refined with mentorship from biotech founders and feedback from the synthetic biology community.","slug":"goalgi","body":{"type":"root","children":[],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:goalgi.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/goalgi.md","_stem":"projects/goalgi","_extension":"md"}
