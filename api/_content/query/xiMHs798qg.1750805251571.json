They’re based on the smallest functional parts of camelid antibodies (from camels, llamas, and alpacas), called nanobodies. Because they’re so compact and stable, sybodies can reach parts of a virus or cell that regular antibodies can’t. Scientists create huge libraries of sybodies and screen them quickly—often in just a few days—to find ones that stick tightly to a protein of interest. This makes them incredibly useful for drug development, diagnostic tools, or even blocking viruses like SARS-CoV-2 from infecting cells."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In short, sybodies are like tiny, lab-made antibodies that can be rapidly produced to fight disease, help visualize proteins in research, or serve as building blocks for future biotech therapies."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:adaptyv-sybodies.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/adaptyv-sybodies.md","_stem":"projects/adaptyv-sybodies","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/projects/deepchem","_dir":"projects","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Virtual drug screening for HIV using DeepChem","description":"","slug":"deepchem","body":{"type":"root","children":[],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:deepchem.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/deepchem.md","_stem":"projects/deepchem","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/projects/glioblastoma-palisades","_dir":"projects","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Palisades in Glioblastoma","description":"","slug":"glioblastoma-palisades","body":{"type":"root","children":[],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:glioblastoma-palisades.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/glioblastoma-palisades.md","_stem":"projects/glioblastoma-palisades","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/projects/goalgi","_dir":"projects","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Goalgi","description":"","slug":"goalgi","body":{"type":"root","children":[],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:goalgi.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/goalgi.md","_stem":"projects/goalgi","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/projects/hlca-single-cell-spatial","_dir":"projects","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"hlca-single-cell-spatial","description":"","slug":"hlca-single-cell-spatial","body":{"type":"root","children":[],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:hlca-single-cell-spatial.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/hlca-single-cell-spatial.md","_stem":"projects/hlca-single-cell-spatial","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/projects/igem-2019","_dir":"projects","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"iGEM 2019","description":"","slug":"igem-2019","body":{"type":"root","children":[],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:igem-2019.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/igem-2019.md","_stem":"projects/igem-2019","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/projects/indian-biopolicy-guide","_dir":"projects","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Indian Biopolicy Guide","description":"","slug":"indian-biopolicy-guide","body":{"type":"root","children":[],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:indian-biopolicy-guide.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/indian-biopolicy-guide.md","_stem":"projects/indian-biopolicy-guide","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/projects/latch-wfs","_dir":"projects","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Workflows for Latch","description":"","slug":"latch-wfs","body":{"type":"root","children":[],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:latch-wfs.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/latch-wfs.md","_stem":"projects/latch-wfs","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/projects/neuronal-infographics","_dir":"projects","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Neuron Infographics","description":"","slug":"neuronal-infographics","body":{"type":"root","children":[],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:neuronal-infographics.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/neuronal-infographics.md","_stem":"projects/neuronal-infographics","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/projects/optorepressilator","_dir":"projects","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"3-gene optorepressilator model","description":"","slug":"optorepressilator","body":{"type":"root","children":[],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:optorepressilator.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/optorepressilator.md","_stem":"projects/optorepressilator","_extension":"md"}]
