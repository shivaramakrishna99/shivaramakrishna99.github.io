Building on Ayensa-Jiménez et al.’s “go-or-grow” model, which simulates tumor cell proliferation and migration driven by oxygen gradients, we hypothesized that cell adhesion significantly influences the formation and maintenance of GBM structures such as necrotic cores and pseudopalisades. We validated this by formulating an adhesion-dependent flux term and integrating it into the original model. Our improved model more accurately reproduces in vitro observations of GBM cell behavior in microfluidic environments and highlights the growing impact of adhesion over time, particularly in double pseudopalisade regions. These results emphasize the importance of accounting for physical cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in modeling tumor progression and may support future therapeutic modeling efforts.","slug":"glioblastoma-palisades","body":{"type":"root","children":[],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:glioblastoma-palisades.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/glioblastoma-palisades.md","_stem":"projects/glioblastoma-palisades","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/projects/goalgi","_dir":"projects","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Goalgi","description":"Goalgi was envisioned as an end-to-end digital lab notebook—like a “Notion for biology”—designed to help researchers plan, document, and share their experimental workflows in a modular, reproducible format.

Using public datasets, we performed detailed quality control, clustering, and trajectory inference on both normal and cancerous lung cells, revealing altered lineage relationships and key differentially expressed genes such as AGER and CAV1 in Type I pneumocytes. To preserve spatial context, we mapped single-cell-derived cell type labels onto tissue sections through a custom cosine-distance-based label transfer pipeline. This enabled the localization of distinct immune and epithelial populations within the tumor microenvironment and highlighted disrupted intercellular communication networks using LIANA-based ligand-receptor analysis. Together, this integrative approach captures both transcriptional diversity and spatial architecture, offering insights into disease progression and biomarker localization in SqCLC.","slug":"hlca-single-cell-spatial","body":{"type":"root","children":[],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:hlca-single-cell-spatial.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/hlca-single-cell-spatial.md","_stem":"projects/hlca-single-cell-spatial","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/projects/igem-2019","_dir":"projects","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"iGEM 2019","description":"I led the “House of Toeholds” iGEM project.

Using differential equation modeling, bifurcation analysis, and dynamic simulations, we examined the stability and controllability of these circuits.
