<h4 class="font-classic italic font-bold">Hi, I’m Shiva! <span class="not-italic pl-4">👋🏼</span></h4>
<br>

I'm a computational biologist in the [Subramaniam Lab](https://genome.ucsd.edu/) and M.S. candidate in [Bioengineering](http://be.ucsd.edu) at UC San Diego. 

**My current research focuses on using large language models to uncover immune cell states across infectious diseases.**

Previously, I’ve worked on molecular modeling at [Adaptyv Biosystems](https://www.adaptyvbio.com/), RNA switch prediction using graph neural networks at [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research), and contributed to bioinformatics workflow development at [LatchBio](https://latch.bio/). 

I am interested in biology, open science, programming, and design.

Feel free to explore my corner of the internet.
