## Hi, I'm Shivaramakrishna.

### I also go by <i>Shiva</i>.

Iâ€™m a second-year M.S. Bioengineering student at [UC San Diego](http://be.ucsd.edu) and a Graduate Student Researcher in the [Subramaniam Lab](https://genome.ucsd.edu/).

My research focuses on leveraging large language models for precise cell-type annotation in single-cell RNA-seq data. Additionally, I'm developing deep learning methods to characterize cellular states in disease progression for my master's thesis.

I am interested in biology, programming, and typography.

Feel free to explore my corner of the internet.
