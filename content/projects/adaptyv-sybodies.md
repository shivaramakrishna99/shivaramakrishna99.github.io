title: Molecular Modelling for Adaptyv Biosystems
slug: adaptyv-sybodies
description: At Adaptyv Biosystems, I worked on Absolut, a molecular dynamics pipeline to predict the binding affinity and structural stability of synthetic nanobodies across 16 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants. My contributions included implementing RMSD-based stability metrics, computing binding energy estimates, and building interactive Python modules for 3D visualization of receptor-binding domains. This work supported high-throughput screening of nanobodyâ€“antigen interactions for pandemic response and therapeutic design.
