title: Goalgi
slug: goalgi
description: Goalgi was envisioned as an end-to-end digital lab notebook—like a “Notion for biology”—designed to help researchers plan, document, and share their experimental workflows in a modular, reproducible format. I built the platform to support biological protocols, metadata tracking, and result annotation with seamless integration of visualization tools. Goalgi was incubated through the iGEM EPIC (Entrepreneurship Program & Innovation Community) initiative, where it was refined with mentorship from biotech founders and feedback from the synthetic biology community.
