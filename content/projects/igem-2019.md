I led the “House of Toeholds” iGEM project. Developed a novel biosensor to detect cervical cancer by targeting microRNA biomarkers using machine learning engineered toehold switch systems. We built and designed and built a modular detection pipeline composed of six key phases—host, miRNA input, plasmid, restriction nuclease, reporter gene, and detection—that together enable sensitive, specific, and programmable readouts. Our team optimized the system using chloramphenicol‑resistant DH5α cells and validated functionality in vitro, while also raising awareness about cervical cancer and the importance of Pap smear screening through community engagement initiatives
