description: A comprehensive overview of the shipping policies in India. The kinds of samples in the purview of this policy analysis include Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), microorganisms, nucleic acids, proteins and cultures, human samples and Living Modified Organisms (LMOs). We have compared and analysed Import, Export and Domestic shipping policies. Our methodology included a systematic and critical review of the history of shipping policies both within and outside the Indian region over a span of three decades that formed the foundation for our understanding of regulatory bodies as well as facilitate comparison of shipping policies. Finally we also analysed the supply chain model of vaccines to get a birds eye view of policy relaxations given ensuring their rapid movement which guided our recommendations to facilitate better implementation.
