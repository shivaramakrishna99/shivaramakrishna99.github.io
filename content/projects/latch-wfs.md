title: Workflows for Latch
slug: latch-wfs
description: Contributed to open-source, community-driven bioinformatics tooling at LatchBio by developing modular GUI-based workflows in Python using Flyte for key computational biology tools. This included pipeline design and utility scripts for the Nucleic Acid Package (NUPACK), core and export modules for FAMSA (multiple sequence alignment), and interactive molecular visualization using 3Dmol.js. Additionally, contributed improvements to the LatchSDK, enhancing the developer experience for reproducible, scalable bioinformatics applications.
