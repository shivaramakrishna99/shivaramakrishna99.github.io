My contributions included implementing RMSD-based stability metrics, computing binding energy estimates, and building interactive Python modules for 3D visualization of receptor-binding domains. This work supported high-throughput screening of nanobodyâ€“antigen interactions for pandemic response and therapeutic design.",{"title":7,"searchDepth":23,"depth":23,"links":24},3,[],"markdown","content:projects:adaptyv-sybodies.md","content","projects/adaptyv-sybodies.md","projects/adaptyv-sybodies","md",1753933238762]
