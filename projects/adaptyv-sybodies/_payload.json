My contributions included implementing RMSD-based stability metrics, computing binding energy estimates, and building interactive Python modules for 3D visualization of receptor-binding domains. This work supported high-throughput screening of nanobodyâ€“antigen interactions for pandemic response and therapeutic design.","adaptyv-sybodies",{"type":12,"children":13,"toc":14},"root",[],{"title":7,"searchDepth":15,"depth":15,"links":16},3,[],"markdown","content:projects:adaptyv-sybodies.md","content","projects/adaptyv-sybodies.md","projects/adaptyv-sybodies","md",1753135340529]
