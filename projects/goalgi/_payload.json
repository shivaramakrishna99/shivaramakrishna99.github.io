I built the platform to support biological protocols, metadata tracking, and result annotation with seamless integration of visualization tools. Goalgi was incubated through the iGEM EPIC (Entrepreneurship Program & Innovation Community) initiative, where it was refined with mentorship from biotech founders and feedback from the synthetic biology community.","goalgi",{"type":12,"children":13,"toc":14},"root",[],{"title":7,"searchDepth":15,"depth":15,"links":16},3,[],"markdown","content:projects:goalgi.md","content","projects/goalgi.md","projects/goalgi","md",1753073868505]
