I built the platform to support biological protocols, metadata tracking, and result annotation with seamless integration of visualization tools. Goalgi was incubated through the iGEM EPIC (Entrepreneurship Program & Innovation Community) initiative, where it was refined with mentorship from biotech founders and feedback from the synthetic biology community.",{"title":7,"searchDepth":23,"depth":23,"links":24},3,[],"markdown","content:projects:goalgi.md","content","projects/goalgi.md","projects/goalgi","md",1753978230740]
