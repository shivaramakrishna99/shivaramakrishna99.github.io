This included pipeline design and utility scripts for the Nucleic Acid Package (NUPACK), core and export modules for FAMSA (multiple sequence alignment), and interactive molecular visualization using 3Dmol.js. Additionally, contributed improvements to the LatchSDK, enhancing the developer experience for reproducible, scalable bioinformatics applications.","latch-wfs",{"type":12,"children":13,"toc":14},"root",[],{"title":7,"searchDepth":15,"depth":15,"links":16},3,[],"markdown","content:projects:latch-wfs.md","content","projects/latch-wfs.md","projects/latch-wfs","md",1753074080552]
